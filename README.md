# HTML Hackathon Project - Multipage Website

## Overview
I am participating in an HTML hackathon where the goal is to create a **multipage website using only HTML**.  
This project demonstrates my skills in building structured web pages, navigation, lists, tables, and linking multiple pages together without using CSS or JavaScript.

## Features
- Fully built using **HTML only**.
- Proper use of **headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images**.
- Semantic HTML structure for better readability and accessibility.
- Easy navigation between pages.
