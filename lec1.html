        <h3>Principle 1: The Need to Share Information</h3>
        <p>To transfer data from Computer A to Computer B, the simplest method is physically carrying it, like using a
          USB drive, but this is slow and doesn’t scale well. A better approach is to connect the two computers directly
          with a cable, such as Ethernet or fiber optic, allowing signals like voltage or light pulses to represent 1s
          and 0s. This forms a <b>direct link</b>, which is the most basic type of computer network.</p>

          <h3>Principle 2: The Problem of Scale</h3>
          <p>When more than two computers need to communicate, directly connecting each one to every other becomes
            impractical, as the number of cables grows rapidly and doesn’t scale. The solution is to use a central
            device, called a <b>switch</b>, where each computer connects with just one cable. If Computer A wants to
            send data to Computer C, it sends the message to the switch, which then forwards it only to the intended
            computer. This setup forms a <b>Local Network</b>, allowing multiple computers in the same area, such as an
            office or home, to communicate efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Principle 3: The Problem of Connecting Networks</h3>
        <p>Once we have local networks in different places, like two offices across town, the challenge is connecting
          them. Running cables between every computer in both networks is impossible, so the solution is to connect the
          networks themselves. This is done using a special device called a Router, which links one local network to
          another and forwards traffic between them. By connecting routers from different networks, we can create a
          large web of interconnected systems. This forms the basis of the Internet: a network of networks, made up of
          countless private and public local networks connected together through routers.</p>

        <h3>Principle 4: The Problem of Finding Anyone (Addressing)</h3>
        <p>In a global web of interconnected networks, every device needs a unique way to be identified so messages
          reach the correct destination. This is solved by the IP Address (Internet Protocol Address), which works like
          a digital street address (e.g., 142.250.184.142). Each device is assigned one, ensuring it can be uniquely
          located. When a message is sent, routers read the destination IP address and decide where to forward it next.
          They don’t know the entire journey, only the best next “hop” that brings the message closer to its
          destination. This system allows communication across millions of computers worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Principle 5: The Problem of Reliability and Fairness</h3>
        <p>Sending a big file all at once is slow and risky, so the file is split into small pieces called packets. Each
          packet has some data, the sender and receiver’s IP addresses, and a number to keep them in order. Packets may
          travel on different paths, but at the end, the receiver collects them, fixes any missing parts, and puts them
          back together. The rules that handle this process are called TCP/IP, the main protocol of the internet.</p>
